# Executive Summary: Real Estate Listings Web App

The Real Estate Listings Web App is a Python-based platform that provides users with an easy-to-use interface to search for real estate properties in the US and get actual price predictions using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm. This project utilizes the Scikit-learn library, Realty Mole Property API, Pandas, Folium, and Streamlit to provide a seamless user experience.

The app has two primary functionalities: the search listings feature and the actual price prediction feature. Users can search for properties by selecting a state, city, and number of listings, and the app will display a table with the selected listings. Additionally, users can enter an address in a text input, and the app will use the Random Forest Regressor algorithm to predict the actual price of the property.

The Real Estate Listings Web App also provides calculations for investors to evaluate the potential profitability of a property. These calculations include monthly mortgage payments, monthly rent, monthly expenses, cash flow, cap rate, and cash-on-cash return. These metrics are displayed in a table for each property, along with other relevant details.

Future improvements to this project could include adding more search criteria, using a different algorithm to improve price prediction accuracy, and implementing a database to store search results and predicted prices.

Overall, the Real Estate Listings Web App is a valuable tool for anyone interested in real estate investment, providing users with easy access to real estate data and price predictions.
